# Weather App

Web application that can display weather data by inputting weather data according to the location using API from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

#### The project will continue to be updated, because there is no work anyway :D

## installation

To deploy the web

### Install Module First

```bash
npm i
```

To install all the modules required by the project

## Enter apikey into environment

```bash
VITE_KEY="" <-- Enter the apikey you got in [https://www.weatherapi.com/]
```
Replace the .env.example file to .env

### Run the Web

```bash

```

This is useful for us to be able to see the results of the web that we have worked on, npm run dev itself is used during development sessions to make it easier to change/modify the project.
